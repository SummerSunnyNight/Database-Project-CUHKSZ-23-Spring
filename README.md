# Database-Project-CUHKSZ-23-Spring
## This is a simple SQL project assignment getting me familiar with the basic syntax of sql
## You may take a look in the assignment1.pdf to know what those sql files are used to. 
Briefly speaking, Q1.sql is responsible for creating the database, while the rest of the files are just used to manipulating the data according the need in assignment1.pdf 
# Hope you can enjoy them!
